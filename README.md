Freshbyte Task Tracker

If you're not Freshbyter then look away . This will help us track our tasks , simple as that . 

I've settled with using Ruby + ~~WxRuby (for GUI : http://wxruby.rubyforge.org/doc/)~~ FXRuby for now , but might switch to GTK2 later if documentation isn't good enough . 

Installation
------------
- ~~gem install <github.com/downloads/sfeu/wxruby/wxruby-ruby19-2.0.2-x86-linux.gem> (for Ubuntu 12.04+)~~
- gem install fxruby
- gem install google_drive
- gem install sqlite3
